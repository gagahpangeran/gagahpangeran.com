Happy new year!

<!-- excerpt -->

I started this year by being sick on the first week of the year. It sucks, but
luckily with just three days of bed rest at home, I become healthy again.

To start the first post of 2025, I want to tell about my plans for my website
this year.

- I want to migrate this website to NextJS because I want to learn this cool
  framework. Also seems like GatsbyJS is already abandoned and will no longer
  received any updates.

- I want to redesign this website to something much simpler design. Some kind of
  monospace style website without too much color.

- I will try to post at least once a month. If there is no big post, I just do
  something simple like this post.

That's it. I hope this year will be better than previous year.

See you!
